      <div class="boldtext">OUR SECRET</div>
      <div class="regulartext">We use a nylon micro-fiber material that allows the wallets both to hold more without becoming overstuffed and to fit comfortably in your purse or pants. The non-slip coating prevents your important items, such as your credit cards, from falling out of your wallet.
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="boldtext"> DURABILITY </div>
      <div class="regulartext">Our customers get 4-5 years of life from our nylon line. Our leather-nylon hybrid lines last 5+ years. Unlike regular wallets, Big Skinny wallets feature double-edged stitching which means the material is folded in, glued, and then stitched. </div>
      <br>
      <div class="boldtext"> THICKNESS </div>
      <div class="regulartext">Our wallets are 10 times thinner and lighter depending on the design and type of leather. Our thin nylon material keeps your wallet at least 50% thinner than regular wallets that have thick leather layers. Most Big Skinny wallets weigh 1 ounce or less versus 3-6 ounces for most regular leather wallets.</div>
      <br>
      <div class="boldtext"> COMPOSITION </div>
      <div class="regulartext">Our wallets are made with new super-thin nylon micro-fiber material that is lined on the reverse with a non-slip coating to make it harder to lose your cards and cash. Also our nylon-microfiber wallets are 100% Vegan.</div>
